	<p>
		After going to college, I would not have any money since the global government caused money to become worthless since they
		printed so much of it. I would be living at my parentsâ€™ house that is located in London, which is the global capital. I
		would still be eating canned food since at this point it is the only food to exist on planet Earth.
