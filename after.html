    <p> 
      After going to collage I would still live at my parents house. During chollage I would not take out any student loans. I would get a job at the local Mc Donalds being a cashier. I would make 2100 dollars per month. I would spend this money on movie tickets. I would go to the movies once a week wich would cost me 60 dollars per month. I would save the remaning 2040  plus cash I earn and keep it for next month
