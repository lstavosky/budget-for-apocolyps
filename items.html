    <p> 
    The things i would need to buy would be groceries which cost 116, a credit card which is billed annually as 147. this all I would need since I would be living at home and would not have to pay for living. The total cost would be 263 dollars which would leave me with 963 dollars left. What I would do with the remaining money is to save it until the next month.
